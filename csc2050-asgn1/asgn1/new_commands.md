### trap 



trap: trap [-lp] [[arg] signal_spec ...]
    Trap signals and other events.
    
    Defines and activates handlers to be run when the shell receives signals
    or other conditions.
    
    ARG is a command to be read and executed when the shell receives the
    signal(s) SIGNAL_SPEC.  If ARG is absent (and a single SIGNAL_SPEC
    is supplied) or `-', each specified signal is reset to its original
    value.  If ARG is the null string each SIGNAL_SPEC is ignored by the
    shell and by the commands it invokes.
    
    If a SIGNAL_SPEC is EXIT (0) ARG is executed on exit from the shell.  If
    a SIGNAL_SPEC is DEBUG, ARG is executed before every simple command.  If
    a SIGNAL_SPEC is RETURN, ARG is executed each time a shell function or a
    script run by the . or source builtins finishes executing.  A SIGNAL_SPEC
    of ERR means to execute ARG each time a command's failure would cause the
    shell to exit when the -e option is enabled.
    
    If no arguments are supplied, trap prints the list of commands associated
    with each signal.
    
    Options:
      -l	print a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers
      -p	display the trap commands associated with each SIGNAL_SPEC
    
    Each SIGNAL_SPEC is either a signal name in <signal.h> or a signal number.
    Signal names are case insensitive and the SIG prefix is optional.  A
    signal may be sent to the shell with "kill -signal $$".
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless a SIGSPEC is invalid or an invalid option is given.

### read


read: read [-ers] [-a array] [-d delim] [-i text] [-n nchars] [-N nchars] [-p prompt] [-t timeout] [-u fd] [name ...]
    Read a line from the standard input and split it into fields.
    
    Reads a single line from the standard input, or from file descriptor FD
    if the -u option is supplied.  The line is split into fields as with word
    splitting, and the first word is assigned to the first NAME, the second
    word to the second NAME, and so on, with any leftover words assigned to
    the last NAME.  Only the characters found in $IFS are recognized as word
    delimiters. By default, the backslash character escapes delimiter characters
    and newline.
    
    If no NAMEs are supplied, the line read is stored in the REPLY variable.
    
    Options:
      -a array	assign the words read to sequential indices of the array
    		variable ARRAY, starting at zero
      -d delim	continue until the first character of DELIM is read, rather
    		than newline
      -e	use Readline to obtain the line
      -i text	use TEXT as the initial text for Readline
      -n nchars	return after reading NCHARS characters rather than waiting
    		for a newline, but honor a delimiter if fewer than
    		NCHARS characters are read before the delimiter
      -N nchars	return only after reading exactly NCHARS characters, unless
    		EOF is encountered or read times out, ignoring any
    		delimiter
      -p prompt	output the string PROMPT without a trailing newline before
    		attempting to read
      -r	do not allow backslashes to escape any characters
      -s	do not echo input coming from a terminal
      -t timeout	time out and return failure if a complete line of
    		input is not read within TIMEOUT seconds.  The value of the
    		TMOUT variable is the default timeout.  TIMEOUT may be a
    		fractional number.  If TIMEOUT is 0, read returns
    		immediately, without trying to read any data, returning
    		success only if input is available on the specified
    		file descriptor.  The exit status is greater than 128
    		if the timeout is exceeded
      -u fd	read from file descriptor FD instead of the standard input
    
    Exit Status:
    The return code is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, read times out
    (in which case it's greater than 128), a variable assignment error occurs,
    or an invalid file descriptor is supplied as the argument to -u.

### expr
Usage: expr EXPRESSION
  or:  expr OPTION

      --help        display this help and exit
      --version     output version information and exit

Print the value of EXPRESSION to standard output.  A blank line below
separates increasing precedence groups.  EXPRESSION may be:

  ARG1 | ARG2       ARG1 if it is neither null nor 0, otherwise ARG2

  ARG1 & ARG2       ARG1 if neither argument is null or 0, otherwise 0

  ARG1 < ARG2       ARG1 is less than ARG2
  ARG1 <= ARG2      ARG1 is less than or equal to ARG2
  ARG1 = ARG2       ARG1 is equal to ARG2
  ARG1 != ARG2      ARG1 is unequal to ARG2
  ARG1 >= ARG2      ARG1 is greater than or equal to ARG2
  ARG1 > ARG2       ARG1 is greater than ARG2

  ARG1 + ARG2       arithmetic sum of ARG1 and ARG2
  ARG1 - ARG2       arithmetic difference of ARG1 and ARG2

  ARG1 * ARG2       arithmetic product of ARG1 and ARG2
  ARG1 / ARG2       arithmetic quotient of ARG1 divided by ARG2
  ARG1 % ARG2       arithmetic remainder of ARG1 divided by ARG2

  STRING : REGEXP   anchored pattern match of REGEXP in STRING

  match STRING REGEXP        same as STRING : REGEXP
  substr STRING POS LENGTH   substring of STRING, POS counted from 1
  index STRING CHARS         index in STRING where any CHARS is found, or 0
  length STRING              length of STRING
  + TOKEN                    interpret TOKEN as a string, even if it is a
                               keyword like 'match' or an operator like '/'

  ( EXPRESSION )             value of EXPRESSION

Beware that many operators need to be escaped or quoted for shells.
Comparisons are arithmetic if both ARGs are numbers, else lexicographical.
Pattern matches return the string matched between \( and \) or null; if
\( and \) are not used, they return the number of characters matched or 0.

Exit status is 0 if EXPRESSION is neither null nor 0, 1 if EXPRESSION is null
or 0, 2 if EXPRESSION is syntactically invalid, and 3 if an error occurred.

### cut 


Usage: cut OPTION... [FILE]...
Print selected parts of lines from each FILE to standard output.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -b, --bytes=LIST        select only these bytes
  -c, --characters=LIST   select only these characters
  -d, --delimiter=DELIM   use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter
  -f, --fields=LIST       select only these fields;  also print any line
                            that contains no delimiter character, unless
                            the -s option is specified
  -n                      (ignored)
      --complement        complement the set of selected bytes, characters
                            or fields
  -s, --only-delimited    do not print lines not containing delimiters
      --output-delimiter=STRING  use STRING as the output delimiter
                            the default is to use the input delimiter
  -z, --zero-terminated   line delimiter is NUL, not newline
      --help        display this help and exit
      --version     output version information and exit

Use one, and only one of -b, -c or -f.  Each LIST is made up of one
range, or many ranges separated by commas.  Selected input is written
in the same order that it is read, and is written exactly once.
Each range is one of:

  N     N'th byte, character or field, counted from 1
  N-    from N'th byte, character or field, to end of line
  N-M   from N'th to M'th (included) byte, character or field
  -M    from first to M'th (included) byte, character or field

### tail


Usage: tail [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.
With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file name.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -c, --bytes=[+]NUM       output the last NUM bytes; or use -c +NUM to
                             output starting with byte NUM of each file
  -f, --follow[={name|descriptor}]
                           output appended data as the file grows;
                             an absent option argument means 'descriptor'
  -F                       same as --follow=name --retry
  -n, --lines=[+]NUM       output the last NUM lines, instead of the last 10;
                             or use -n +NUM to skip NUM-1 lines at the start
      --max-unchanged-stats=N
                           with --follow=name, reopen a FILE which has not
                             changed size after N (default 5) iterations
                             to see if it has been unlinked or renamed
                             (this is the usual case of rotated log files);
                             with inotify, this option is rarely useful
      --pid=PID            with -f, terminate after process ID, PID dies;
                             can be repeated to watch multiple processes
  -q, --quiet, --silent    never output headers giving file names
      --retry              keep trying to open a file if it is inaccessible
  -s, --sleep-interval=N   with -f, sleep for approximately N seconds
                             (default 1.0) between iterations;
                             with inotify and --pid=P, check process P at
                             least once every N seconds
  -v, --verbose            always output headers giving file names
  -z, --zero-terminated    line delimiter is NUL, not newline
      --help        display this help and exit
      --version     output version information and exit

NUM may have a multiplier suffix:
b 512, kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024,
GB 1000*1000*1000, G 1024*1024*1024, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y, R, Q.
Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.

With --follow (-f), tail defaults to following the file descriptor, which
means that even if a tail'ed file is renamed, tail will continue to track
its end.  This default behavior is not desirable when you really want to
track the actual name of the file, not the file descriptor (e.g., log
rotation).  Use --follow=name in that case.  That causes tail to track the
named file in a way that accommodates renaming, removal and creation.

### wc


Usage: wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...
  or:  wc [OPTION]... --files0-from=F
Print newline, word, and byte counts for each FILE, and a total line if
more than one FILE is specified.  A word is a nonempty sequence of non white
space delimited by white space characters or by start or end of input.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

The options below may be used to select which counts are printed, always in
the following order: newline, word, character, byte, maximum line length.
  -c, --bytes            print the byte counts
  -m, --chars            print the character counts
  -l, --lines            print the newline counts
      --files0-from=F    read input from the files specified by
                           NUL-terminated names in file F;
                           If F is - then read names from standard input
  -L, --max-line-length  print the maximum display width
  -w, --words            print the word counts
      --total=WHEN       when to print a line with total counts;
                           WHEN can be: auto, always, only, never
      --help        display this help and exit
      --version     output version information and exit

                                see full documentation for supported strings
  -R, --random-sort           shuffle, but group identical keys.  See shuf(1)
      --random-source=FILE    get random bytes from FILE
  -r, --reverse               reverse the result of comparisons
      --sort=WORD             sort according to WORD:
                                general-numeric -g, human-numeric -h, month -M,
                                numeric -n, random -R, version -V
  -V, --version-sort          natural sort of (version) numbers within text

Other options:

      --batch-size=NMERGE   merge at most NMERGE inputs at once;
                            for more use temp files
  -c, --check, --check=diagnose-first  check for sorted input; do not sort
  -C, --check=quiet, --check=silent  like -c, but do not report first bad line
      --compress-program=PROG  compress temporaries with PROG;
                              decompress them with PROG -d
      --debug               annotate the part of the line used to sort,
                              and warn about questionable usage to stderr
      --files0-from=F       read input from the files specified by
                            NUL-terminated names in file F;
                            If F is - then read names from standard input
  -k, --key=KEYDEF          sort via a key; KEYDEF gives location and type
  -m, --merge               merge already sorted files; do not sort
  -o, --output=FILE         write result to FILE instead of standard output
  -s, --stable              stabilize sort by disabling last-resort comparison
  -S, --buffer-size=SIZE    use SIZE for main memory buffer
  -t, --field-separator=SEP  use SEP instead of non-blank to blank transition
  -T, --temporary-directory=DIR  use DIR for temporaries, not $TMPDIR or /tmp;
                              multiple options specify multiple directories
      --parallel=N          change the number of sorts run concurrently to N
  -u, --unique              output only the first of lines with equal keys;
                              with -c, check for strict ordering
  -z, --zero-terminated     line delimiter is NUL, not newline
      --help        display this help and exit
      --version     output version information and exit

KEYDEF is F[.C][OPTS][,F[.C][OPTS]] for start and stop position, where F is a
field number and C a character position in the field; both are origin 1, and
the stop position defaults to the line's end.  If neither -t nor -b is in
effect, characters in a field are counted from the beginning of the preceding
whitespace.  OPTS is one or more single-letter ordering options [bdfgiMhnRrV],
which override global ordering options for that key.  If no key is given, use
the entire line as the key.  Use --debug to diagnose incorrect key usage.

SIZE may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes:
% 1% of memory, b 1, K 1024 (default), and so on for M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y, R, Q.

*** WARNING ***
The locale specified by the environment affects sort order.
Set LC_ALL=C to get the traditional sort order that uses
native byte values.

### bc

`bc` is a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers with interactive execution of statements. There are
some similarities in the syntax to C programming, A standard library is available by command line option.
If requested, the math library is defined before processing any files. `bc` starts by processing code from all
the files listed on the command line in the order listed. After all files have been processed,
`bc` reads from the standard input. All code is executed as it is read. (If a file contains to hald the processor,
`bc` will never read from the standard input.)






usage: bc [options] [file ...]
  -h  --help         print this usage and exit
  -i  --interactive  force interactive mode
  -l  --mathlib      use the predefined math routines
  -q  --quiet        don't print initial banner
  -s  --standard     non-standard bc constructs are errors
  -w  --warn         warn about non-standard bc constructs
  -v  --version      print version information and exit
